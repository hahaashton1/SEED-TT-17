# Python using Django
## For Scheduled Transactions 

Tasks:
1. Return a list of transaction details of a user
2. Insert transactions created from frontend
3. Delete future transaction entry

## Summary
For our backend, we used Django and mySQL.
First, we created the necessary Database models in models.py
Secondly, we seeded the date within the database in 0004_seedUserData.py
Thirdly, in views.py, we created various functions in Python to View, Update and Delete the Scheduled Transactions Database.
